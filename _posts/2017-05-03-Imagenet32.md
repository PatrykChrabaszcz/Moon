# Imagenet32 Dataset
**[Github](https://github.com)**  
**[Paper](https://arxiv.org/)**
## General information
Imagenet32 dataset is a downsampled version of the original [Imagenet](http://image-net.org/)
dataset, where images were resized to 32 x 32 pixels by the 'box' algorithm from [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/4.1.x/) library.

Imagenet32 contains 1281167 training images from 1000 classes and 50000 validation images with 50 images per class.


Link to [dataset](https://figshare.com/articles/Imagenet_32/4960082) (3.81Gb)

File format was inspired by [CIFAR](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset.  
You would need Python3 to unpickle files (its default encoding differs from Python2)

```python
# Note that this will work with Python3
def unpickle(file):
    with open(file, 'rb') as fo:
        dict = pickle.load(fo)
    return dict
```

There are 10 files with training data ("file train\_data\_batch\_#"). Each of them contains python dictionary with fields:

* **'data'** - numpy array with uint8 numbers of shape **samples x 3072**. First 1024 numbers represent red channel, next 1024 numbers green channel, last 1024 numbers represent blue channel. See [CIFAR](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) website.
* **'labels'**- number representing image class, indexing starts at 1 and it uses mapping from **map_clsloc.txt** file provided in original Imagenet devkit
* **'mean'** - mean image computed over all training samples, included for convenience, usually first preprocessing step removes mean from all images.

One file with validation data ("val_data") contains python dictionary with fields **'data'** and **'labels'** (There is no **'mean'** field)


## How dataset was prepared


* Download imagenet dataset.

* Use [image_resizer_imagenet.py](https://github.com/) script to resize images. See **--help** for more info.

```bash
python image_resizer_imagent.py -i ~/images/ILSVRC2015/Data/CLS-LOC/train -o ~/data/ -s 32 -a box -r -j 10 
python image_resizer_imagent.py -i ~/images/ILSVRC2015/Data/CLS-LOC/val -o ~/data/val -s 32 -a box
```
It's worth to check log files after scripts finish. Some images might cause problems. Copying content to new image and resaving fixes this issue.

* Use [image2numpy_imagenet_train.py](https://github.com/) and [image2numpy_imagenet_val.py](https://github.com/) script to create files with training images and files with validation images.

```bash
python image2numpy_imagenet_train.py -i ~/data/box -o ~/out_data_train
python image2numpy_imagenet_val.py -i ~/data/val/box -o ~/out_data_val
```
Note that the first script requires a lot of RAM, it should not be hard however to change the code to use less memory. Training images are first randomly shuffled, then divided into 10 groups and saved in 10 files.
 

## Usage in Python3

To read one of the files and use it in [Lasagne](http://lasagne.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) framework (NCHW format) you would use:

```python
def load_databatch(data_folder, idx, img_size='32x32'):
    data_file = os.path.join(data_folder, 'train_data_batch_')

    d = unpickle(data_file + str(idx))
    x = d['data']
    y = d['labels']
    mean_image = d['mean']

    x = x/np.float32(255)
    mean_image = mean_image/np.float32(255)

    # Labels are indexed from 1, shift it so that indexes start at 0
    y = [i-1 for i in y]
    data_size = x.shape[0]

    x -= mean_image
    if img_size == '32x32':
        x = np.dstack((x[:, :1024], x[:, 1024:2048], x[:, 2048:]))
        x = x.reshape((x.shape[0], 32, 32, 3)).transpose(0, 3, 1, 2)
    elif img_size == '64x64':
        x = np.dstack((x[:, :4096], x[:, 4096:8192], x[:, 8192:]))
        x = x.reshape((x.shape[0], 64, 64, 3)).transpose(0, 3, 1, 2)
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError

    # create mirrored images (optional)
    X_train = x[0:data_size, :, :, :]
    Y_train = y[0:data_size]
    X_train_flip = X_train[:, :, :, ::-1]
    Y_train_flip = Y_train
    X_train = np.concatenate((X_train, X_train_flip), axis=0)
    Y_train = np.concatenate((Y_train, Y_train_flip), axis=0)

    return dict(
        X_train=lasagne.utils.floatX(X_train),
        Y_train=Y_train.astype('int32'),
        mean=mean_image)
```

## Displaying images

Script [test.py](https://github.com) will generate set of large images containing all images from a given file. Additionally it is possible to display histograms showing how many images are in this file for each of the classes.
